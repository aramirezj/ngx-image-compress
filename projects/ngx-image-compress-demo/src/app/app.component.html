    <h2>About ngx-image-compress</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>ngx-image-compress</code> library is a popular choice for image compression in Angular applications. It provides a
        straightforward and easy-to-use solution for compressing images on the client-side.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some reasons why <code>ngx-image-compress</code> can be considered a good library:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Simple integration: The library is easy to install and integrate into your Angular project. It follows the Angular module
            pattern and provides a service that you can inject and use in your components.
        </li>
        <li>
            Compression options: <code>ngx-image-compress</code> offers options to control the level of compression and the output image
            quality. You can specify the desired compression ratio and the target image quality.
        </li>
        <li>
            Performance: The library performs image compression on the client-side, eliminating the need for server-side processing. This
            can improve performance by reducing the size of image files before they are uploaded or transmitted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross-browser support: <code>ngx-image-compress</code> works across different browsers and provides consistent compression
            results. It handles compatibility issues and browser-specific quirks to ensure reliable image compression.
        </li>
        <li>
            Active development and community support: The library is actively maintained and has a community of users who provide support
            and contribute to its development. This ensures that issues are addressed, bugs are fixed, and the library stays up-to-date.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        However, it's important to note that the choice of an image compression library depends on your specific requirements and
        preferences. You may also consider other libraries or alternative approaches based on your project's needs, such as server-side
        compression or using different client-side image compression libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before finalizing your decision, it's recommended to evaluate the library based on your project's requirements, check its
        documentation and community support, and consider any performance or compatibility considerations specific to your application.
    </p>

    For your tests you can download and upload the following images:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="/assets/picture-5-MB.jpg" target="_blank" download>
                Testing the algorithm: JPG 5 MB - can me compressed without reducing width/height.
            </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/assets/picture-no-compression-available.jpg" target="_blank" download>
                Testing a normal case: JPG 3 MB - no compression available without reducing size.
            </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/assets/up_exif.jpg" target="_blank" download>
                Testing Orientation: This arrow is actually pointing left, but it should be pointing up once compressed, in order to be
                displayed correctly (Exif Orientation = rotation 90Â° clockwise)
            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
